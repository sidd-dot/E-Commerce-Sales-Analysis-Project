*E-commerce Sales Analysis Project*

This project aims to analyze sales data from an e-commerce platform to gain insights into customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends. The dataset consists of sales data from an online retailer, including customer demographics (age, gender, location), product information (product ID, category, price), sales data (date, time, quantity, revenue), and order information (order ID, customer ID, order date). The dataset contains approximately 10,000 rows and 21 columns.

*Technology Used:*

The analysis will be performed using Python, with libraries such as *pandas* for data manipulation and analysis, and *plotly* for data visualization. Pandas will be used to clean, transform, and analyze the data, while plotly will be used to create interactive and dynamic visualizations to help identify trends and patterns in the data. 

*Analysis and Insights:*

The analysis will focus on identifying sales trends, customer segments, and product performance. The insights gained from this analysis will help the e-commerce company to optimize marketing strategies, improve product offerings, and increase sales revenue. Some of the specific analysis tasks will include: analyzing sales data by product category and region, identifying high-value customer segments, and examining the relationship between customer demographics and purchase behavior. The results will be presented in a series of interactive dashboards and reports, using plotly and other visualization tools.
